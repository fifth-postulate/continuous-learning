# Let's compare JavaScript & Elm

---

# Functional Language

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b
}
```

--

```elm
add a b =
  a + b
```

---

# Strong Typed


```javascript
'a' + 1
```

--

```elm
'a' + 1
```

---

# Immutable

```javascript
let a = 4
const b = 3

a = b
b = a
```

--

```elm
a = 4
b = 3
```

--

Except in the REPL

---

# Compiled to JavaScript

## JavaScript

Problems found at runtime

--

## Elm

A lot of problems found at compile time
